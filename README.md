- 👋 Hi, I’m Josh
- 👀 I’m interested in application security, how to secure future technologies, and tethics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the philosophy of romanticism, Rust, how other people are using seamlessly integrating security to design the future, how to threat model AI and quantum systems, and how to be more productive.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all of the above.
